        <div class="history">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>In 1999 Counter-Strike was released as a mod for Half-Life. As the game progressed from a beta to a full release, it refined the classic gameplay that has come to define competitive shooters and produced a dedicated community that has followed
                the game since its first release.</p>
            <p>Through each of its iterations - 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive - Counter-Strike has been the de facto benchmark of a player&rsquo;s first person shooter skill. Teams from around the world demonstrate their abilities and strategies in local,
                regional, and international tournaments streamed to millions of viewers across the globe.</p>
            <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) expands upon the team-based first person shooter gameplay the original Counter-Strike pioneered when it launched in 1999. Two teams compete in multiple rounds of objective-based game modes with the
                goal of winning enough rounds to win the match.</p>
            <p>CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic Counter-Strike maps like Dust, Inferno, Nuke, Train, and more. In addition, CS:GO introduces new game modes like Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman and
                Wingman, and features online matchmaking and Competitive Skill Groups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mode">
            <h3>Wingman</h3>
            <p>Queue by yourself or grab a friend in this 2v2 best-of-16 game mode on single bomb site maps. Players earn a Skill Group exclusive to Wingman and play using the Competitive Bomb Defusal ruleset. Buy weapons, armor, and defuse kits in an effort
                to plant the bomb or defend the bomb site!</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Casual</h3>
            <p>Ready to play some Counter-Strike but don&rsquo;t want to commit to a full 30 round match? Find a Casual match and play at your own pace in this drop-in, drop-out game mode.</p>
            <p>In Casual mode players automatically receive armor and defusal kits, play with a simplified economy, and team damage has been turned off. Join a game and begin mastering CS:GO&rsquo;s fundamentals!</p>

        <div class="mode">
            <h3>Deathmatch</h3>
            <p>This fast-paced Casual game mode allows instant respawns and encourages rapid engagements. After spawning, players have a limited amount of time to buy weapons of their choice and engage the enemy.</p>
            <p>Kills with different weapons are worth different point amounts, and throughout the match players will be given bonus points for achieving kills with selected weapons. Respawn immediately and get back to the fight!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mode">
            <h3>Arms Race</h3>
            <p>Arms race is a gun-progression mode featuring instant respawning designed for rapid close quarters combat.</p>
            <p>Players gain new weapons immediately after registering a kill as they work their way through each weapon in the game. Get a kill with the final weapon, the golden knife, and win the match!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mode">
            <h3>Demolition</h3>
            <p>In Demolition players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced gameplay.</p>
            <p>Players are automatically granted a starting weapon and advance through a sequence of firearms when they register a kill. The more kills you earn the further you&rsquo;ll advance towards stronger weapons which give your team an advantage,
                like powerful sniper rifles!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mode">
            <h3>Flying Scoutsman</h3>
            <p>This Casual 8v8 game mode features reduced gravity, does not penalize players for shooting while moving, and only allows two weapons &ndash; SSG 08 sniper rifles and knives. Take to the skies and eliminate your enemies; the first team to 9
                rounds wins!</p>

                </h3>OG joined the likes of FaZe and Natus Vincere in the 1-0 pool following their victory over MOUZ in the first round of the European RMR. The result was hard-fought, with Christopher "⁠dexter⁠" Nong's young squad pulling a comeback
                attempt in the second half with a solid CT performance, but in the end, cooler heads prevailed. Casper "⁠ruggah⁠" Due's perfectly timed pauses combined with Mateusz "⁠mantuu⁠" Wilczewski's fantastic form was enough to push OG over the
                finishing line, 16-12.</div>
